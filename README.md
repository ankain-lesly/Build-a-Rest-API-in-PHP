### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Lesly Chuo.
Checking out this PHP Development Stack challenge.

This is working standard PHP restfull API setup application with routing system.
It serves data in a Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format which could easily be integrated in any application. Object Oriented Programming with namespace system is highly in use includeing features such as.



### Workflow

Using PHP namespace system to organize an import class object into API.php page for further validation

```php
// Importing Class Obj
use App\Config\Router;
// use App\Config\ErrorHandler;
use App\Controllers\ProductController;
use App\Controllers\CategoryController;
use App\Controllers\UserController;
use App\Config\CustomErrorValidator;

```

### Routing
Object Oriented Programming provides a variety of methods and approach to resolve a coding procedue. Making use of PHP associative arrays and call_user custom fuctions make this process quite interesting..


Here we get a route mapped to a controller class pointing to a specific method in execution.


### Error Handling

Custom errors and exception handling to catch customize and return errors or exceptions when need be

### User Authentication

Full featured user signup/login registration system with token authentication


### Resource Management

User data control, profile, create products and category pages


## My process

Development still in progress... I will be updating promply
